Leaf Disease Classification using CNN

This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using Transfer Learning to classify tomato leaf diseases. Three popular deep learning architectures — InceptionV3, VGG19, and ResNet50 — were evaluated on a Kaggle dataset to compare their accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and general performance on agricultural disease detection.

The goal of this project is to build a reliable image-based disease classification system that can support early diagnosis and precision agriculture applications.

Project Overview:

We trained and evaluated three deep learning models:

InceptionV3 – Best performing, highly accurate

VGG19 – Strong baseline, high accuracy

ResNet50 – Underperformed due to optimization challenges

Each model was trained separately in its own Jupyter Notebook. A dedicated notebook performs the train-validation split with preprocessing and augmentation.

How to Run the Project:
1. Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Download the dataset
Place all images into:

    data/dataset/

3. Create train-validation split

    01_train_valid_split.ipynb

4. Train any model

    02_model_resnet50.ipynb
    03_model_vgg19.ipynb
    04_model_inceptionv3.ipynb

5. Evaluate

Confusion matrices, accuracy curves, and loss curves are automatically generated inside each notebook.

Model File:

The best-performing model (best_model.keras) is saved under:

    models/best_model.keras

Not uploaded to GitHub due to file size limitations.
You may store it on Google Drive and link it if needed.

Future Improvements:
* Train using cloud GPU (Google Colab, AWS, or Kaggle Notebooks)
* Expand dataset with real-field images
* Test EfficientNet or MobileNetV3
* Deploy lightweight model for mobile app or IoT devices
* Perform hyperparameter optimization (especially for ResNet)
